Convert from Modern English to Old English. Old English is the language of the Anglo-Saxons (up to about 1150), a highly inflected language with a largely Germanic vocabulary, very different from modern English. As this is a really old language you may not find all modern words in there. Also a single modern word may map to many Old English words. So you may get different results for the same sentences different time.
